  "summary": "Completed comprehensive testing of Enhanced LittleHelper AI platform. Backend APIs are 97.6% functional with all new admin endpoints, global assistant, knowledge caching, and AI provider management working correctly. Frontend loads successfully with admin login, global assistant widget, and admin panel access confirmed. Only minor issue: LLM endpoint returns 404 (expected due to missing /api/llm/generate route).",
